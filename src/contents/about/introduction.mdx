I obtained my Bachelor's degree from [National Central University 🐿️](https://www.ncu.edu.tw/), driven by a _sincere passion_ for **Software Engineering 💻.**

My current research interests include **_Programming Language Theory, Operating Systems, and Compilers._** To gain practical experience, I developed my own **_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a>_** interpreter using **<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>** <sup>[[Code](https://github.com/1chooo/compiler-101)]</sup> and implemented [**_Monkey Programming_**](https://monkeylang.org/) Compiler with [**GO**](https://go.dev/) <sup>[[Code](https://github.com/1chooo/monkey-prog-lang)]</sup>.

In my spare time, I do workouts 💪🏻, street photography 📸 and tech content writing ✍🏻.

I will apply for Master's programs in Computer Science for 2024-25 cycle. Here is my current [CV](/resume) <sup>[[Docs]](/Resume-Gaurav-Panchal.pdf)</sup> (August 2024).

**`Self-motivated, Team player, Love coding 👨🏻‍💻`**
